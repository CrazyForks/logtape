=================

Version 0.3.0
-------------

To be released.


Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on April 20, 2024.

 -  Sinks now can be asynchronously disposed of.  This is useful for
    sinks that need to flush their buffers before being closed.

     -  Added `dispose()` function.
     -  The return type of `configure()` function became `Promise<void>`
        (was `void`).
     -  The return type of `reset()` function became `Promise<void>`
        (was `void`).
     -  Configured sinks that implement `AsyncDisposable` are now disposed
        of asynchronously when the configuration is reset or the program exits.

 -  The return type of `getStreamSink()` function became
    `Sink & AsyncDisposable` (was `Sink & Disposable`).

 -  Added `getRotatingFileSink()` function.
