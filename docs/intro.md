===============

LogTape is a logging library for JavaScript and TypeScript.  It provides a
simple and flexible logging system that is easy to use and easy to extend.
The highlights of LogTape are:

 -  [*Library support*](./manual/library.md): LogTape is designed to be used
    in libraries as well as applications.  You can use LogTape in libraries
    to provide logging capabilities to users of the libraries.

 -  [*Runtime diversity*](./manual/install.md): LogTape supports [Deno],
    [Node.js], [Bun], edge functions, and browsers.  You can use LogTape in
    various environments without changing the code.

 -  [*Structured logging*](./manual/start.md#structured-logging): You can log
    messages with structured data.

 -  [*Hierarchical categories*](./manual/categories.md): LogTape uses
    a hierarchical category system to manage loggers.  You can control

    different levels of the category hierarchy.

    template literals for log messages.  You can use template literals to log
    messages with placeholders and values.

    capabilities to redact sensitive information from logs using pattern-based
    or field-based approaches.

 -  [*Dead simple sinks*](./manual/sinks.md): You can easily add your own sinks
    to LogTape.
